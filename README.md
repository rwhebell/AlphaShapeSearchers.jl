# AlphaShapeSearchers.jl

This package provides [alpha shapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_shape) (concave hulls) as well the ability to query whether a point is contained within an alpha shape.

'AlphaShapes.jl' was taken, although that package provides different functionality to 'fit' an optimal alpha to a dataset.

See `example.jl` for usage.
